# Crypto Clustering

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data using K-Means clustering. The analysis is performed on both the original scaled data and the data transformed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to identify distinct clusters of cryptocurrencies that share similar characteristics.

## Contents

- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and clustering.
- `crypto_market_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms including K-Means and PCA.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
